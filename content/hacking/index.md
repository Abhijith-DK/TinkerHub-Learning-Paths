## Programming Knowledge

Programming knowledge is a must obviously.

### Learn Python,PHP,JS,HTML&CSS :rocket:

1. Basic knowledge about HTML,CSS&JS is must.
2. Learn any server side language like Python,PHP or Ruby.
3. If you want to code your own exploits, learn C.

:bulb: The python book [Learn python3: the hardway](https://www.amazon.in/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0134692888) is a good resource.


### Install and setup stuffs :construction:

Things you need and need not.

1. A :computer: running any linux based OS :white_check_mark: (You can also use windows, but it sucks.)
2. A :brain: to think :white_check_mark:
3. Kali linux :exclamation: (even ubuntu will do the work)
4. Problem solving skills :white_check_mark:
5. Investigation oriented mind :white_check_mark:


#### :full_moon_with_face: Only do this if you have plans to learn. First learn, then earn. There will be some time you may find yourself lost.

### Next steps (recommended)
Do the following to take learning to the next level
1. Learn to code your own tools.
```
Programming your own tools is best step to become leet from noob. 
You will learn a lot in this process about security related concepts.
```

* Won’t find at the beginning, don’t lose hope
* Stay focused
* Depend on yourself
* Stay updated with InfoSec world
